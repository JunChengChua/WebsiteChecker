# WebsiteChecker
If your memory is like mine, it's hard to tell if a website has changed sometimes, so this can help tell you if you're going slightly crazy

Just run the code and type in a website to lock in what it looks like now, then go back to this code whenever you'd like and run it again with the same link to find out if the information has changed.
